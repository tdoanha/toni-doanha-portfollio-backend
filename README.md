# Toni Doan-Ha Portfolio Backend

Here lies the backend server for my portfolio that I'm working on. 

## Features that I'm working on:

- Viewing all posts
  - Sorting them in latest to oldest, oldest to newest
- Editing older posts
- Deleting posts

## Getting Started

### Installation

You'll need to clone this project and install the node modules via the terminal: `npm install`

Then create a .env file for PostgreSQL credentials and where the server is being hosted:

- USERNAME
- HOST
- DATABASE
- PASSWORD
- SERVER_PORT
- DATABASE_PORT

### Usage

Use `npm start` to run the app on https://localhost:3000.
